   <h2><b>A Short Exerpt on Church</b></h2>
   <h4>1st of December, 2020</h4>
   <p>
     The following comes from the definitive edition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine">Thomas Paine's</a> <i>Age of Reason</i>, a very important and interesting book. It exposits the nature of church. Note, in this context <i>church</i> refers generally to institutionalized religion.
   </p>
   <p>
     <br />"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> says, 'Love, truth, compassion, service, sympathy, tenderness exist in the hearts of men, and are the essence of religion, but try to encompass these things in an institution and you get a church - and the Church stands for and has always stood for coercion, intolerance, injustice, and cruelty.'<br /><br />
     No man has ever lifted up his voice or pen in a criticism against love, truth, compassion, service, sympathy, tenderness. And if he had, do you think that love, truth, compassion, service, sympathy, tenderness would feel it necessary to go after him with stocks, chains, thumbscrews, and torches?<br /><br />
     You cannot imagine it.<br /><br />
     Then what is it goes after men who criticize the prevailing religion and show where it can be improved upon? Why, it is hate, malice, vengeance, jealousy, injustice, intolerance, cruelty, fear.<br /><br />
     The reason the Church does not visit upon its critics today the same cruelties that it did three-hundred years ago is simply because it has not the power. Incorporate a beautiful sentiment and hire a man to preach and defend it, and then buy property and build costly buildings in which to preach your beautiful sentiment, and if the gentleman who preaches your beautiful sentiment is criticized he will fight and suppress his critics if he can. And the reason he fights his critics is not because he believes the beautiful sentiment will suffer, but because he fears losing his position which carries with it ease, honors and food, and a parsonage and a church, taxes free."<br /><br />At this point in my life, I completely reject the dogmatic, illogical (<i>tips fedora</i>) institutions of religion.<br /><br />With that said, one of the only things I appreciate about religion is the scaffolding of morality and society it provides, yet I think philosophy is better applied in that regard.
