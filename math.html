   <h2><b>Introduction to Notes on Precalculus</b></h2>
   <h4>1st of February, 2021</h4>
   <p>
     I am currently in the beginning of the second semester of my first year of college. I am enrolled in my local community college, and I am majoring in computer science. I would like to foster and grow my interest in the general field of mathematics, so I am creating these notes, aiming to truly understand the basics of mathematics.<br /><br />

     In this series of notes, I will be using the textbook prescribed for my current math class, MATH58: Precalculus Trigonometry, a book called <i>Precalculus</i> by Robert Blitzer.<br /><br />
