   <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
   <h2><b>-Introduction</b></h2>
   <h4>23rd of September, 2020</h4>
   <p>Yo! Welcome to my first blog post. I am excited to begin this. There will be little-to-no traffic on this site, but that is OK. Really, the main purpose I have for this site is to have a spot to dump my thoughts, opinions, and experiences, all made accessible to the public.<i> I am used to talking to myself, so the lack of traffic will not be a problem. :-)</i><br /><br />
   </p>
   <p>As mentioned on my homepage, my interests include:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Exercise (Running & Calisthenics)</li>
     <li>Reading</li>
     <li>Philosophy</li>
     <li>History</li>
     <li>Politics</li>
     <li>Information Technology</li>
     <li>Self-Sufficiency</li>
   </ul>
   <p>That's all, folks. Let's get to blogging.</p>
