   <p><b>Angles and Radian Measure</b></p>
   <ul>
     <li>An angle consists of two rays with a common endpoint, the vertex.</li>
     <li>An angle is in standard position if its vertex is at the origin and its initial side lies along the positive x-axis. </li>
     <li>A quadrantal angle is an angle with its terminal side on the x-axis or the y-axis.</li>
     <li>Angles can be measured in degrees. 1° is 1/360 of a complete rotation.</li>
     <li>Acute angles measure more than 0° but less than 90°, right angles 90°, obtuse angles more than 90° but less than 180°, and straight angles 180°.</li>
     <li>Angles can be measured in radians. One radian is the measure of the central angle when the intercepted arc and radius have the same length. In general, the radian measure of a central angle is the length of the intercepted arc divided by the circle's radius:  θ =s/r.</li>
     <li>To convert from degrees to radians, multiply degrees by π radians/180°. To convert from radians to degrees, multiply radians by 180°/ π radians.</li>
     <li>To draw angles measured in radians in standard position, it is helpful to "think in radians" without converting to degrees.</li
     <li>Two angles with the same initial and terminal sides are called coterminal angles. Increasing or decreasing an angles measure by multiples of 360° or 2π produces coterminal angles.</li>
     <li>The arc length formula is s = rθ</li>
     <li>The definition of linear speed is v = s/t, angular speed is w = θ/t.</li>
     <li>Linear speed is expressed in terms of angular speed by v = rw, where v is the linear speed of a point of a distance r from the center of rotation and w is the angular speed in radians per unit of time.
