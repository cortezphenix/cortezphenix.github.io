   <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
   <h4>23rd of September, 2020</h4>
   <div align="center"><p>Yo! Welcome to my first blog post. I am excited to begin this. There will be little-to-no traffic on this site, but that is OK. Really, the main purpose I have for this site is to have a spot to dump my thoughts, opinions, and experiences, all made accessible to the public. My goal is to write content, then be able to access it anywhere. <i> I am used to talking to myself, so the lack of traffic will not be a problem. :-)</i><br /><br />

   <p>That's all, folks. Let's get to writing.</p>
