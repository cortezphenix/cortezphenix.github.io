     Around five days ago, the pointer finger of my right hand became painful. I knew immediately that the pain was a result of my poor typing habits, so I stopped typing. A couple of days later, I visited my doctor. He told me to rest my hands, buddy-tape my middle and pointer finger, and take ibuprofen. Going without using my computer, and running for that matter, I rested my hands. Soon enough the tendonitis was not that bad, and I regained mobility and shed pain.

     Now that I have resumed use of my computer, I have adopted some new habits, ideally preventing the flaring up of anything again.<br /><br />
     I will:
     <ul>
       <li>type, read, and write with proper posture</li>
       <li>take 5-minute breaks from typing every ~45-60 minutes</li>
       <ul>
	 <li>perfect time to stretch and get a quick workout in</li>
       </ul>
       <li>begin touch typing, to improve ergonomics and typing speed</li>
     </ul>
     This Christmas, one of my gifts was an external keyboard. After typing on crappy, laptop keyboards, using my new one was a pleasant change. Relative to other keyboards, mine is compact. It is the <a href="https://amzn.to/1YrU9nM">Corsair K65 RGB</a>, with 100% Cherry Red MX RGB mechanical key switches.
