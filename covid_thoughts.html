   <h2><b>My Thoughts on the COVID-19 Pandemic</b></h2>
   <img src="virus.jpeg" width="150" height="150" alt="da virus" class="center" title="da virus"/>
   <h4>24th of September, 2020</h4>
   <p style="tab">For my first <i>real</i> blog post, I would like to share my thoughts on the COVID-19 pandemic. I am generally ignorant on the scientific aspect of the virus, and I do not want to foster false information. Additionally, I am a little skeptical about reported data from entities, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization">WHO</a> (World Health Organization), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party">CCP</a> (Chinese Communist Party), as well as the numerous organizations, both public and private, of the United States of America.<br /><br />All of these entities have the incentive to spread misinformation, and it is likely that they all do. I will discuss the political aspects, international and intranational, of the virus in a future blog post. The purpose of this page is to reflect upon the nonpolitical ramifications of the pandemic.<br />
   </p>
   <h4>Social Issues</h4>
   <p>
     The pandemic has disrupted many aspects of life, more so for those of us in developed nations. For those living in generally isolated nations, I doubt the day-to-day life has changed, to the same degree of a nation like the USA. It has greatly changed the way our society functions, and it has brought the <b>fragility</b> of <i>the system</i> to the forefront of the minds of many. The widespread adoption of mask wearing, social distancing, and the like are the most notable social changes. Of course, I am for the wearing of masks and social distancing, yet I also like to compare and contrast those things with the social nature of humans.<br />
   </p>
   <p>
     The wearing of masks blocks a vital part of human communication. I am not referring to voices being muffled, but I am referring to how the mouth is a vital part of body language. We use it to express mood and such. When worn, masks also block the smiles of others.<br />
   </p>
   <p>
     Additionally, perhaps more importantly, social distancing creates many issues. Humans, by nature, are intended to interact with others. That much is obvious, but I am not sure if the majority of people realize the negative of impacts of social distancing. On the subject of socializing, I think many of the people I know of have fooled themselves into thinking that they are socializing, with <i>pseudo-social media</i>. However, that was a problem far before the pandemic. I will discuss the consequences and benefits of social media in a future post.<br/><br/>
   </p>
   <h4>Livelihood Issues</h4>
   <p>The pandemic has also disrupted aspects of the national supply chain. The most noteworthy example is the <span style="color:red">toilet paper</span> craze, caused by the reactions of consumers to the media. Retailers often took to rationing toilet paper. Many of these hysterical consumers wanted to get toilet paper, before the stores and economy shut down. This shows an important flaw in the thinking of the masses. <i>If</i> the economy and supply chain were to truly collapse, the last thing on one's mind should be toilet paper. <i>If</i> the economy and supply chain were to truly collapse, the more important items would be non perishable foods, water firearms, and ammunition. Firearm sales incidentally saw a spike, not due to the pandemic, but due to the social unrest in many urban areas, as a result of the killing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests">George Floyd</a>. I will discuss the rioting and police brutality in a future post.</p>
   <p><b>Moral of the story</b>: Reduce your dependence on things that are outside your control. That is a good rule-of-thumb to orient your life around.</p>

   <p>UPDATE (20-10-2020): Yeah, I'm not gonna write more about riots or da virus. :-P</p>
